 * cross-checkout ownership lease keyed by `(comm_id, resource_id)` (for Telegram,

 * path — NOT under the overridable state root — so every daemon on the user
 * account, regardless of its `AGENTS_COMM_BUS_ROOT` / state root, contends on the
 * same lock file. The daemon arbitrates; the adapter merely declares its resource
 * (`exclusiveResource()`) and is gated behind the lease by {@link wrapWithLease}.
