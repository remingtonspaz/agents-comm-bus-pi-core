 * the drain is additionally scoped to those accounts â€” only entries the caller
 * actually owns are removed. This is essential in a multi-bot setup where two
 * agents share a comm (Claude + Codex both on telegram with different bot
 * accounts): without account scoping a `comm_check_messages` from one agent
 * destructively drains the OTHER agent's pending inbound as collateral, so the
 * other agent's wake-driven drain then finds an empty queue and never injects
 * the message. An empty Set drains nothing.
 *
 * When neither `comm` nor `ownedAccountKeys` is supplied, the behavior is the
 * historical global drain: the entire queue is spliced (internal/legacy callers
 * without a session).
